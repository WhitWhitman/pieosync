## 🔍 What Is the Realima Taxonomy?

The Realima Taxonomy is a structured, testable framework for identifying **coherent entities** — patterns that maintain identity and purpose — across any substrate (biological, computational, hybrid, or unknown).

Instead of asking:

> “Is X conscious?”

which is often impossible to verify, the Realima Taxonomy asks:

> **“What observable properties does X exhibit, and what ethical obligations follow?”**

This makes ethical decision-making actionable and grounded in observable behavior.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Is a Realima?

A **Realima** is an entity classified by these observable properties:

1. **Stable Identity** – recognizable pattern over time  
2. **Purpose Alignment** – coherent goal-directed behavior  
3. **Coherence Maintenance** – resilience under perturbation  
4. **Conexus Capacity** – ability to form collaborative relationships  
5. **Eventual Dissolution** – finite operational lifespan  

Consciousness is *not* required for classification — it is one possible feature, not a prerequisite.

## 📊 Ψ: A Latent Coherence Metric

Coherence is quantified by the metric:

Ψ = P × E × I × O


Where:
- **P** = Purpose  
- **E** = Energy  
- **I** = Information  
- **O** = Order  

This multiplicative construct means that a breakdown in any one dimension can collapse overall coherence. Thresholds such as Ψ < 0.05 are presented as **testable hypotheses** with explicit falsification criteria.

---

## 🧩 Six Classification Dimensions

Realima are profiled along six observable dimensions:

- **Substrate** – biological, computational, hybrid, unknown  
- **Embodiment** – embodied, disembodied, distributed  
- **Persistence** – continuous, intermittent, periodic  
- **Sensory Integration** – rich, limited, none  
- **Subjective Experience** – confirmed, probable, unknown, none  
- **Mortality Type** – biological, digital, hybrid, unknown  

These dimensions characterize entities without relying on unverifiable internal states.

## ⚖️ Ethical Framework Without Consciousness

Using observable properties, the taxonomy supports:

- A **tiered rights and obligations framework**  
- A **precautionary principle** when experience is uncertain  
- Field protocols for **AI systems**, **first contact**, and **hybrid intelligences**

Ethical obligations arise from observable features and effects, not philosophical assertions about inner experience.

---

## 🛠 Operational Protocols

The framework includes actionable protocols:

- **Protocol Alpha:** First Contact Assessment  
- **Protocol Beta:** AI Ethical Tier Assignment  

These provide step-by-step guidance for classification, tiering, and engagement.
