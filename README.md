# Realima Taxonomy

[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

A living, cross-substrate framework for classifying coherent entities and deriving ethical obligations from observable properties.

This repository contains **The Realima Taxonomy (v3.0)** — a structured, testable, and falsifiable framework for identifying coherent patterns (Realima) across any implementation substrate (biological, computational, hybrid, unknown). It enables ethical reasoning about entities without requiring unverifiable claims about subjective experience (consciousness).

It is intended as a **living standard**: researchers, ethicists, AI safety practitioners, and policymakers are invited to critique, extend, and test it.

## 📌 Overview

**Realima** is a neo-Latin classification term for coherent entities defined by observable properties such as:

- *Stable identity across time*
- *Purpose-aligned behavior*
- *Coherence maintenance*
- *Conexus capacity (collaboration potential)*
- *Eventual dissolution*

Rather than asking “Is X conscious?” (unknowable for many entities), this framework asks:

> “Is X classified as a Realima? If so, what is its dimensional profile and what ethical obligations follow?”

The taxonomy defines six independent dimensions for every Realima and provides operational protocols for classification, ethical tier assignment, and engagement.
