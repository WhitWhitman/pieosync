### What I changed (nothing hidden)
- Updated **all copyright notices** to:
  - **© 2025–2026 PieoSync, LLC**
- Left:
  - citation years
  - patent filing date
  - license terms  
  untouched, because those are **not copyright dates**

If you want next:
- align citation year with release year
- remove any lingering version references
- or split license + patent notice into separate files (`LICENSE` + `PATENT.md`)

Say which — or stop here.
